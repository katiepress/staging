<p>I’ve had an idea floating around for a while to do a tidy text analysis on X-Files episode scripts. The X-Files has been around long enough that there are tons of fandom sites, and you can easily find transcripts of the original 9 seasons.First, I wanted to get some basic information about the episodes, so that’s what this post will focus on. My first thought was to go to Wikipedia. There is a page with tables for each season and I can use that as the base URL for scraping.</p>
<p>Packages used in this first episode:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tidyverse, obviously. This is always the first package I load.</li>
<li>Janitor, which has a couple of functions I like to use, especially clean_names() to clean and remove special characters from column names in new datasets.</li>
<li>Rvest, which can be used to scrape data from websites.</li>
<li>Googlesheets4, which is an update of the original googlesheets package. I can use this to store my data because I have more than one computer I use on a regular basis.<br />
</li>
<li>Extrafont (pretty self-explanatory).</li>
<li>Ggiraph for graph animation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, on to the X-Files.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>wiki &lt;- &quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_X-Files_episodes&quot;</code></pre>
<p>To find out what selector you need to look at the tables of interest, you can use a Chrome extension called SelectorGadget, or you can just right click on the specific spot on a website and choose “inspect” in the dropdown menu that comes up - which is what I usually do.</p>
<p>In this case it’s pretty easy, the html nodes I’m interested in are simply “table” class. At first glance, it looks like tables 2 through 14 are “wiki episode table”. That’s one more than I would expect, because there are nine original seasons, and then two follow-up seasons that came out more recently (10-11). However, there are also two X-Files movies, which appear to have separate tables. I don’t want to deal with those right now really, so I will leave them out when I scrape the tables.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>wiki %&gt;%

## [19] &lt;table class=&quot;nowraplinks hlist mw-collapsible autocollapse navbox-inner ...</code></pre>
<p>So before we get the tables, I’m just going to select the nodes I actually want to collect, then use html_table to gather them all in table format.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tables &lt;- wiki %&gt;%
  read_html() %&gt;%
  html_nodes(., &quot;table&quot;) %&gt;%
  .[c(2:6, 8:11, 13:14)] %&gt;%
  html_table(fill = TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>I won’t show all the tables just for the sake of space, but here is the first one. It looks like the “prod code” column is going to cause issues when I try and map them to one dataframe, because in some cases there are hyperlinks which results in inconsistent column names. (Hint: the table is interactive so you can flip over to the other columns or down to the next page).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tables[[1]]</code></pre>

<p>I’m going to add names to this list of dataframes before I clean the column names.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>names(tables) &lt;- rep(paste0(&quot;Season &quot;, 1:11))</code></pre>
<p>Now to get the column names. They are all the same aside from the issue I mentioned earlier.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>names(tables[[1]] %&gt;% clean_names())
## [1] &quot;no_overall&quot;           &quot;no_inseason&quot;          &quot;title&quot;               
## [4] &quot;directed_by&quot;          &quot;written_by&quot;           &quot;original_air_date&quot;   
## [7] &quot;prod_code_40&quot;         &quot;u_s_viewers_millions&quot;</code></pre>
<p>I’ll replace prod_code, and I also want to replace the last column u_s_viewers_millions because it’s a bit long. Usually I would do this right to a dataset, but it’s helpful to be able to see everything before I apply it to the list.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>col.names &lt;- names(tables[[1]] %&gt;% clean_names())

col.names[7] &lt;- &quot;prod_code&quot;
col.names[8] &lt;- &quot;no_viewers&quot;

col.names
## [1] &quot;no_overall&quot;        &quot;no_inseason&quot;       &quot;title&quot;            
## [4] &quot;directed_by&quot;       &quot;written_by&quot;        &quot;original_air_date&quot;
## [7] &quot;prod_code&quot;         &quot;no_viewers&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Now, apply this to the list of dataframes. I can use map and set_names from the purrr package to do this very easily.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tables &lt;- tables %&gt;% 
  map(. %&gt;% set_names(col.names))</code></pre>
<p>Now to gather this list of tables together into one dataframe, I’m using purrr::map_df. I find it useful in certain cases instead of using bind_rows on its own, because I can create a column that tells me where the data came from. In this case, I’m creating a “season” column because each season is a separate dataset. This will be helpful in filtering the data and creating charts later.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>table_df &lt;- tables %&gt;%
  map_df(., bind_rows, .id = &quot;season&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>I know I want to put the date in a proper format, and I also want to fix the number of viewers column.</p>
<p>Fixing the date is simple. I’m just using the stringr function “word” to grab the date within the parenthesis, and the ymd function from lubrdiate to change it from a character to date format. When I used the “sep” argument I used the double backslash because the paranethsis is a special character.</p>
<p>I’m using the same method for the no_viewers column except of course changing it to numeric instead of date.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>table_df &lt;- table_df %&gt;%
  mutate(original_air_date = ymd(word(original_air_date, 2, sep = &quot;\\(&quot;)),
         no_viewers = as.numeric(word(no_viewers, 1, sep = &quot;\\[&quot;)))
## Warning: Problem with `mutate()` input `no_viewers`.
## ℹ NAs introduced by coercion
## ℹ Input `no_viewers` is `as.numeric(word(no_viewers, 1, sep = &quot;\\[&quot;))`.
## Warning in mask$eval_all_mutate(dots[[i]]): NAs introduced by coercion</code></pre>
<p>I also thought I would get some episode ratings from IMDB as well. First I’ll go to the IMDB link for X-Files episodes. Now this is a situation where I will have to navigate to different pages because there is one page for every season. However, all of the pages can be reached using the same link as a base, and pasting the season number onto the end of the string. This code results in a list of 11 links for the read_html function to follow.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>imdb.link &lt;- &quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106179/episodes?season=&quot;

links &lt;- rep(paste0(imdb.link, 1:11))</code></pre>
<p>I need to use map to iterate the code over the list of links. For each link (season), the code is going to use read_html, followed by html_nodes - which I got by using inspect on the page just like with wikipedia. After that, it’s simply using html_text to get the text contained in those nodes, and changing them to numeric.</p>
<p>Again I won’t print them all to save space, but this is what season 1 looks like:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>temp &lt;- links %&gt;%
  map(
    . %&gt;% read_html() %&gt;%
      html_nodes(&quot;.ipl-rating-star.small .ipl-rating-star__rating&quot;) %&gt;%
      html_text() %&gt;%
      as.numeric()
  )

temp[1]
## [[1]]
##  [1] 8.4 8.2 8.7 7.7 7.1 7.3 6.8 8.9 6.2 8.0 8.2 7.5 8.7 7.5 7.1 7.4 8.6 7.2 7.1
## [20] 8.6 8.5 7.2 7.3 9.1</code></pre>
<p>After all that is done, I will use flatten (because the list currently has two levels) and unlist to get the ratings into a vector of 217 ratings. That’s one for each episode, and it matches the number of rows in table_df, so I can just add it as a column.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>table_df &lt;- table_df %&gt;%
  mutate(rating = temp %&gt;% flatten %&gt;% unlist())</code></pre>
<p>I’m also interested in getting the item descriptions. I still want to look at the scripts, but these are short and sweet and I think they’ll be useful. I’ll use the same method as the episode ratings for this.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>temp &lt;- links %&gt;% 
  map(. %&gt;% read_html() %&gt;% 
  html_nodes(&quot;.item_description&quot;) %&gt;%
  html_text())

table_df &lt;- table_df %&gt;%
  mutate(description = temp %&gt;% flatten() %&gt;% unlist() %&gt;% str_trim(., side = &quot;both&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>Here’s the table so far.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>table_df</code></pre>

<p>There is still some cleaning to be done. I have to fix the last episode of season 9, because it’s actually two episodes (201/202). In the wikipedia table they are both on one line.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>table_df &lt;- table_df %&gt;%
  slice(201) %&gt;%
  mutate(
    no_overall = 201,
    no_inseason = 19,
    title = paste0(title, &quot; Part I&quot;)
  ) %&gt;%
  bind_rows(table_df) 



table_df &lt;- table_df %&gt;%
  slice(202) %&gt;%
  mutate(
    no_overall = 202,
    no_inseason = 20,
    title = paste0(title, &quot; Part II&quot;)
  ) %&gt;%
  bind_rows(table_df) %&gt;%
  filter(no_overall &lt; 1920) %&gt;%
  arrange(no_overall)

table_df &lt;- table_df %&gt;%
  mutate(season = factor(
    season,
    levels = c(
      &quot;Season 1&quot;,
      &quot;Season 2&quot;,
      &quot;Season 3&quot;,
      &quot;Season 4&quot;,
      &quot;Season 5&quot; ,
      &quot;Season 6&quot;,
      &quot;Season 7&quot;,
      &quot;Season 8&quot;,
      &quot;Season 9&quot;,
      &quot;Season 10&quot;,
      &quot;Season 11&quot;
    )
  ))

table_df &lt;- table_df %&gt;%
  mutate(title = str_remove_all(title, &quot;‡&quot;)) %&gt;%
  mutate(full_title = paste0(&quot;Episode &quot;, no_inseason, &quot;\n&quot;, title))</code></pre>
<p>Now I can plot the episodes by season and rating. The ggiraph package has a function that will add tooltips to a regular R plot, so I’ve added the episode number and title and it will pop up as your mouse hovers over each point. I put some additional theme formatting in my_theme that I’m not showing here due to space.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>p &lt;- table_df %&gt;% 
  filter(!is.na(rating)) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(rating, fct_rev(season), color = season)) +
  geom_point_interactive(aes(tooltip = full_title, data_id = no_overall),
                         size = 3,
                         alpha = .75) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1, 10, .5)) +
  xlab(&quot;Viewer Rating&quot;) +
  ggtitle(&quot;X Files Episodes by Season and Viewer Rating&quot;) +
  my_theme

girafe(
  ggobj = p,
  fonts = list(sans = &quot;Arial&quot;),
  options = list(
    opts_tooltip(css = tooltip.css,
                 use_fill = TRUE),
    opts_sizing(width = .9)
  )
)</code></pre>
