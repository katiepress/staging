<p>I’m a huge X-Files fan. I also love working with text data. I’ve had an idea floating around for a while to do a tidy text analysis on X-Files episode scripts. The X-Files has been around long enough that there are tons of fandom sites, and you can easily find transcripts of the original 9 seasons.First, I wanted to get some basic information about the episodes, so that’s what this post will focus on. My first thought was to go to Wikipedia. There is a page with tables for each season and I can use that as the base URL for scraping.</p>
<p>Packages used in this first episode:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tidyverse, obviously. This is always the first package I load.</li>
<li>Janitor, which has a couple of functions I like to use, especially clean_names() to clean and remove special characters from column names in new datasets.</li>
<li>Rvest, which can be used to scrape data from websites.</li>
<li>Googlesheets4, which is an update of the original googlesheets package. I can use this to store my data because I have more than one computer I use on a regular basis.<br />
</li>
<li>Extrafont (pretty self-explanatory).</li>
<li>Ggiraph for graph animation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, on to the X-Files.</p>
