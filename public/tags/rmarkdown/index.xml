      <description>I’m a huge X-Files fan. I also love working with text data. I’ve had an idea floating around for a while to do a tidy text analysis on X-Files episode scripts. The X-Files has been around long enough that there are tons of fandom sites, and you can easily find transcripts of the original 9 seasons.First, I wanted to get some basic information about the episodes, so that’s what this post will focus on.</description>
